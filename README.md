# RandomWalker-Java
A Java program that simulates a **random walk** for a user-defined number of steps starting from the origin (0,0). At each step, the walker randomly moves either **up, down, left, or right.** The program prints the coordinates after each move and calculates the **squared Euclidean distance** from the origin after the walk is complete.
